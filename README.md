# Back-end

We are using Routes, Controller, Models, middlewares (for route guarding and user role extracting) and many such things to maintain the code quality, re-usability and manageability.

## Technologies used:
* express
* jsonwebtoken
* mongoose
* socket.io
* bcryptjs

## Database:
For database we are using MongoDB.<br>
The connection string for MongoDB connection is <b><i>mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/TaskManager</i></b></br>
There are two collection in MongoDB:
1. User
2. Task

1. Clone the respository in your local.
2. Setup MongoDB in your local. Create a new connection with the name TaskManager, on the above mentioned URI.
3. Run ```mongod``` command in terminal to start the mongoDB server.
    -   If you cannot find ```mongod``` command, you will have to navigate to the folder <i>[ C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\8.0\bin ]</i> where mongoDB is installed and then execute ```mongod``` command.

## Technologies used:
* Angular
* rxjs
* jwt-decode
* socket.io-client

## How to run TaskManager Front-end?
1. Clone the repository in your local.
2. Make sure you have angular/cli installed on your machine, otherwise you will have to install it.
3. Run ```npm i``` in terminal in the backend folder, to install all the dependencies.
4. Run ```npm start``` or ```ng serve``` in the terminal, your application will start running.
